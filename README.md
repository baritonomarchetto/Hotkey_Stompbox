# Hotkey Stompbox
A DIY stompbox to send keystrokes to your software of choice. Hands free!

Iâ€™ve found myself needing this on more than one occasion over the past few years.

Some time ago, I wanted to send keystrokes to a software looper to start and stop recording my synthesizer output while playing.

Today, I need a device to play and stop a drum loop on my favourite DAW for guitar practice.

Hands-free, is the leitmotiv here!

Whatever your application, if you have ever felt the need for a device that emulates a keyboard to control a software by feet, check this out.

# Supplyes
The PCB I layed down is dimensioned for compatibility with the following components:

  1x aluminum alloy case (1590B, 112 x 60 x 31 mm)

  1x panel mount USB type C TPC connector, 4 wires (those used to add a USB charge slot in cars)

  1X USB type C male connector (those with exposed terminals through a PCB)

The stompbox PCB is populated by the following components:

  1x RP2040 Zero microcontroller board

  2x PCB mount footswitch 3PDT 9 pin (latching or non latching)

  4x PCB mount micro switch 6x6 mm, 20 mm height (tall aren't they? :D)

  2x 680 ohm resistor

  6x 10K ohm resistor

  2x LED, 3mm

To work the aluminum alloy case, I suggest you to use:

  Power driller (mandatory)

  Drill bits for metals (mandatory)

  Step drill bits (optional, but highly recommended)

  Auto center puncher (optional)
  
The biggest hole diameter in this project is 12 mm. Nothing scary then!
